# SmartAssistant
This is a DIY solution to a smart home assistant intended to be run on smaller python computers. This design is meant to be much more accessible than the current
solutions at the top of the market, due to their hefty price tags, as well as much more modular due to the removal of many restrictions that companies often place
on these devices. It also allows for a more sound foundation for a DIY SmartHome system due to the highly-accessible code with a heavy emphasis on being modular.
